# Advent of Code 2023

My attempt at [AoC 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using Python.

## How to run

Requires Python 3.11 to run. In theory, it should be as simple as cloning the repo, `cd` to repo
root and `poetry install`. From there you should be able to do `poetry run all` and the implemented solvers
for each day will run. If you want to run a single day, do e.g. `poetry run one`, `poetry run fifteen`, etc.
